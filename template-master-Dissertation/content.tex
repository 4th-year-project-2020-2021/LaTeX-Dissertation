\chapter*{About this project}
\paragraph{Abstract}
Data visualisation has become popular, in part due to everyone's experience with the global pandemic Covid-19. Information is delivered in easy to understand visual representations. As this is an emerging area, the team decided to investigate different methods of data visualisation, see which performed the best for different scenarios and to develop a data visualisation application. The main focus of the application is on Covid-19, data is being generated at least daily worldwide for Covid-19. The application includes examples of other pandemics such as SARs, MERs and historic epidemics of smallpox and polio.

\paragraph{Authors}
This project was developed as part of a fifteen credit module by Grace Keane, Jina Kim and Shirin Nagle, fourth year students of Galway Mayo Institute of Technology.

\paragraph{Acknowledgements} The authors would like to acknowledge the time and advice given by the project supervisor Dr. John French.

\chapter{Introduction}
This chapter will serve as a prelude to the project. The context, objectives and metrics for success and failure will be defined, followed by a thorough summary of each chapter of the dissertation and its relevance.

\chapter{Context}
During the decision making process the team decided that the project must be relevant as well as interesting. The project must encourage the use of existing skills as well as allow for the natural development of new techniques and processes while also being worthy of scope.

The team felt it would be beneficial as well as informative to create a web application that would take various epidemic data and create a series of data visualisations from it. As well as comparing past and present viruses to distinguish similarities along with differences to get a more in dept view of how these viruses spread, mortality rates, survival rates etc.

\vspace{5mm} %5mm vertical space

Once the project area had been decided on, each team member focused on a pandemic or epidemic, investigated where to source relevant information for the pandemic or epidemic, and investigated different technologies for displaying data in a visual manner.

\begin{itemize}
\item Provide a context for your project.
\item Set out the objectives of the project
\item Briefly list each chapter / section and provide a 1-2 line description of what each section contains.
\item https://github.com/4th-year-project-2020-2021/Final-Year-Project-Data-Visualization.
\\provide a brief list of the main elements at the URL.
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Objectives}
As previously mentioned, the end goal of the project is to create a web application that would analyse different virus data and create various data visualisations to help people get an in dept view of viruses. To ensure the end goal was reached, the team outlined objectives to be followed throughout development.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Investigate the field of interest and scope for the project.
  \item Evaluate and research the appropriate frameworks and tools available for development.
  \item Incorporate state of the art technologies, frameworks, databases and tools that will allow users to view, add, update, delete, post and retrieve data.
  \item The web application will, at a minimum allow users to sign-up, login, view data visualizations, create unique user visuals, post reviews and post user data to databases. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Metrics for Success and Failure}
The outlining criteria for success and failure were important in ensuring the project remained on track throughout development and therefore allow the project to achieve the outlined goals.

\chapter{Methodology}
About one to two pages.
Describe the way you went about your project:
\begin{itemize}
\item Agile / incremental and iterative approach to development. Planning, meetings.
\item What about validation and testing? Junit or some other framework.
\item If team based, did you use GitHub during the development process.
\item Selection criteria for algorithms, languages, platforms and technolo-gies.
\end{itemize}
Check out the nice graphs in Figure \ref{tikz:graphs}, and the nice diagram in Figure \ref{tikz:mydiagram}.

\chapter{Technology Review}
About seven to ten pages.
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe each of the technologies you used at a conceptual level. Standards, Database Model (e.g. MongoDB, CouchDB), XMl, WSDL, JSON, JAXP.
\item Use references (IEEE format, e.g. [1]), Books, Papers, URLs (timestamp) – sources should be authoritative. 
\end{itemize}

\section{XML}
Here's some nicely formatted XML:

\chapter{System Design}
FReMP stack is a very powerful and highly scalable stack which reduces complexity of back-end code, deals with the database requests very quickly and brings a user friendly interface for front-end users.

\begin{center}    
      \includegraphics{img/fremp.PNG}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item Flask
\item React.js
\item MongoDB Atlas
\item Python

These technologies were chosen as they give developers the ability to handle huge volume of data and, at the same time, render a nice modern interface on the client side. 
\item Architecture, UML etc. An overview of the different components of the system. Diagrams etc… Screen shots etc.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{System Evaluation}
As many pages as needed.
\begin{itemize}
\item Prove that your software is robust. How? Testing etc.

\item Measure the outcomes / outputs of your system / software against the objectives from the Introduction.
\item Highlight any limitations or opportuni-ties in your approach or technologies used.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Conclusion}
